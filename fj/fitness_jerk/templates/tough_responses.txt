Done already? Push harder next time!
Sweat more, whine less.
Good start. Now do it again!
Did you even try?
Halfway there, keep grinding.
No pain, no gain. Simple.
Not bad. Next time, double it.
You call that a workout?
Almost respectable. Almost.
Better than nothing, barely.
Don't settle. Keep pushing.
That was just the warm-up.
Keep moving. No excuses.
Show me real effort next time.

Mediocre at best. Improve.
You can do better. Show it.

Don't be satisfied. Strive for more.
That was weak. Up your game.
You're capable of more.
Prove your worth. Push harder.
One step closer. Don't stop.
Not good enough. Do better.
Next time, no shortcuts.
Push until you can't.
That's it? Pathetic.
Break your limits next time.
One workout closer to greatness.
Don't stop now. Keep going.
That was cute. Now try harder.
Keep pushing. Never quit.
